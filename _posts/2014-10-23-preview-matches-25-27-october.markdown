Before each round in the English Permier League we always go through the upcoming fixtures and go through the stats and try to find that one match where we might get something unexpected.
Sometimes we succeed and sometimes we dont. [PLStats.com][league-page] was created to scratch that itch. A single stop for all the stats up need to look at to help you find some interesting
stats for the upcoming fixtures. This week four teams played in the Champions League and three in the UEFA Champions League. This means that these teams play against teams in the English Premier League
this weekend that have had the entire week to prepare for that match. [Arsenal][arsenal-page] played yesterday away in Belgium on saturday they visit [Sunderland][sunderland-page], who lost 8-0 last saturday against
[Southampton][southampton-page] last weekend. Until that match, they had been doing okay [compared to last season][sunderland-compared].
Then on sunday we have another interesting fixture between [Burnley][burnley-page] and [Everton][everton-page]. Burnley are still searching for their first win of the season, started by loosing the first two fixtures of the
season, then three goalless draws in a row, have since then only gathered 1 point in the last three matches, scoring 3 goals against 11. But one might argue that this is their chance to turn their season around. The have scored in the last two
fixtures (after going 565 minutes without scoring) and now play a Everton team that played today in France against Lille and will only get 3 days of rest. And on top of that Everton have not been playing that well in the EPL [compared to last seaon][everton-compared]
