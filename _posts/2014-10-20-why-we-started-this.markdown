We love football. And we love stats. Sometimes we are not sure which one we love more. We started this site as an experiment to see what kind of stats we
can generate from data publicly available. We wanted to create a site where you can easily find stats the you dont find on the regular football sites.
And while doing that we also wanted to make these stats more visual and the experience viewing them more enjoyable.

We launched the site just after this season started and so far we have received positive feedback. We released early, when we only had two pages finalized:
[The league page][league-page] and [the team page][team-page]. And since launching we have continued to add stats to those pages (Minutes since last scored, minutes leading)
and created one [new page][compared-page]. The idea behind the compared to last season page is to get a quick overview of how a team is doing compared to last season.
On that page we compare the fixtures the team has played this season to the corresponding fixture last season. We also show changes in total points, goals scored and goals conceded.

Want to have something to say about what we should implement next? Go to our [Uservoice][uv-page] and recommend a feature.
