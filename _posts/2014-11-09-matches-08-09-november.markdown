As we head into another international break [Chelsea][chelsea-page] sit at top of the league 4 points clear of [Southampton][southampton-page] and 8 points clear of [City][city-page]. Southampton continued their amazing start to the season
and have now gone 410 minutes without conceding, the last goal they conceded was against [the spurs][spurs-page] just over a month ago. Since then they have 4 clean sheets and 4 wins. [Swansea City][swansea-page] also continued to do well, 
beating [Arsenal][arsenal-page] 2-1. They now have +5 points compared to the same [fixtures last season][swansea-last-season]. Its interesting to compare the [Newcastle team][newcastle-page] which has now won 4 in a row and moved up to 8 place, equal on points to [Manchester United][mufc-page]. Newcastle has been leading for 114 minutes, Manchester United 294, yet the results are the same. This is a clear indicator the Manchester United are underperforming and Newcastle overperforming. 

For us, we are going to be using the international break to work on some exciting new features. If you have some feature requests, go to our [Uservoice page][uv-page] and let us know what you want us to work on for the next couple of weeks.
