This sunday we have a classic derby, [Manchester City][city-page] play [Manchester United][united-age]. Whats probably most noteworthy for that fixture is that United concede a lot in the last 30 minutes (6 of their 13 goals) and City score a lot of goals in the last 30 minutes (11 of their 19 goals). Uniteds first half goal difference is 9:5 and Citys second half record is 12:6. So we have a first half team playing a second half team where we can expect a lot of goals in the last 30 minutes, most likely scored by City.
In the other fixutre today we have [Aston Villa][villa-page] hosting [Tottenham Hotspurs][spurs-page]. Spurs have only 1 win in their last 7 games in the EPL and have [8 points less][spurs-sametime] compared to this time last season. But Villa cant score and cant keep a clean sheet. Since winning [Liverpool][lfc-page] on the 13-th of september they have lost 5 games in a row without scoring and always 
conceding 2 or more goals.
