When we started this project one of our goals was always to be open about all the traffic and ad revenue this site generates. Now that the first month has passed it is time to put our money where our mouth is. Before we reveal the number, lets start with what we have learned. 

1. Getting attraction from Twitter is hard. In this one month we have been fairly active on twitter, posting interesting stats and linking back to our site. So far [Our twitter account][twitter-page] only has 16 followers, but slowly growing. We also had a break through when we started posting pictures in our tweets, impressions increased significantly and a lot more engagement.

2. Getting our first $ from adsens is hard. Our first goal was to get 1$ from adsens ads. we still havent reached that goal but we are positive that will happen in november. 

3. Getting users to use your product is hard. For a developer that just wants to crank out code this is a valuable lesson. After only a month of trying to gain attraction, researching different ways to do I have realized just how important good marketing people are. For me it has always been about the code. I havent been that interested in how marketing works but after playing around with this for a few weeks I must say that this is harder than I expected. Much harder. It has also given me the courage to admit that and face the fact that I have a long journey ahead if I want to reach all my goals with 
[plstats.com][pl]. 

To the numbers. I thought long and hard about what numbers to make public. To make it simple I decided upon three number that I think give a clear picture of the progress I am making month by month.
Here are the number for November.

1. Pageview: 420
2. Adsens revenue: 0.12€
3. Adwords cost: 1.92€

Its quite clear that I will not retire from these november numbers but I have every reason to be positive. Already the first 2 days of november have given me more in adsens revenue than all of november (I will not give you any details, you will have to wait for the next update) and traffic is also increasing, both orgaing and from paid ads. So my goal for november is to reach my first goal I set for [plstats.com][pl], 1.0€ in monthly recurring revenue and when we have accomplised that, we can move on to the next goal.
